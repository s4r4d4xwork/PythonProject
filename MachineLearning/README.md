I use the data on this [Github](https://github.com/Brice-Vergnou/spotify_recommendation#readme) for the machine to learn, I'm still learning how to get my own Spotify data track.

The code train_model.py is used to train the model using the highest accuracy classifier.
The code test_model.py is used to test the trained model, I tested first 2 data and it seem to work corectly.
